YouNews is a news application built on the Android platform. It pulls news articles from over 70 news sources 
including NYT, CNN, ABC, BBC, CNBC, ESPN, Fox, Google News, TechCrunch and many more using NewsAPI.orgâ€™s API. 

YouNews also allows users to filter and organize their feed based on their preferences. There are two main filters:
  1. Based on publication - users can choose to only see articles from the NYT for example, released in the past day
  2. Based on category - users can choose to see only articles about sports, politics, entertainment etc.
  
This app makes it simple to get access to all these news sources from a single application, while giving the user a high
degree of control over how their feed gets filtered.
